# rat-client
A classic april fools prank client, this page only exists to prove I'm not actually ratting all my viewers
\
\
build using <code>pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.ico --add-data "image.png;." injector.py</code>\
    requires python and pillow lib
\
\
Also this "client" gets severly flagged by Microsoft Defender, which is odd, but oh well. Never disable realtime protection completely, just create an exeption if you want to launch the client.
